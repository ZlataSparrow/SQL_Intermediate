# 📘 SQL_for_Data_Science

This repo contains my personal SQL practice — organized by topic and structured to build solid query fluency for data analysis and data science work.
I’m working through chapters inspired by the **LinkedIn Learning "Intermediate SQL for Data Scientists" course**, but everything here is written, tested, and organized by me.

---

## 🧠 What I'm Doing Here

- Writing and improving **intermediate SQL queries** across a variety of use cases
- Practicing **joins, aggregations, filtering, window functions, set operations**, and more
- Organizing my work by chapter so it’s easy to revisit or expand
- Adding **LeetCode-style problems** to go beyond the course and test what I’ve learned
- Building a clean, well-commented **SQL practice portfolio** I can refer back to anytime
